# Flask_Website

This is a website I made with the help of a tutorial and plan to iterate on to showcase my portfolio projects. My goal isn't to
be a website designer but to allow for my other projects to be shown in a more presentable manner.

The base website was built with the help of a flask tutorial on youtube:

I've added my own custom pages such as:
- about 
- resume
- projects and pages for each project

Under the projects page is my face privacy project; other projects are currently in development.

Unfortunately GitHub doesn't allow for files over 100MB so you can find the weights file for the yolov3 model at:

The weights file was uploaded from this repository:

Additionally I'd like to give credit to the added dark mode on the website, I used the code from here:
